# 🧠 Machine Learning & AI Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence project repository! This portfolio showcases a wide range of supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning models developed during my internship and academic journey. Each project is implemented using Python and popular ML libraries such as **scikit-learn**, **pandas**, **NumPy**, **matplotlib**, **seaborn**, and **TensorFlow/Keras**. This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence projects developed during my internship, covering a wide range of techniques including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and natural language processing. Each project focuses on solving real-world problems such as cancer detection, sentiment analysis, stock price prediction, and market segmentation using Python and libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, pandas, and matplotlib. The aim of this portfolio is to demonstrate my hands-on experience in building, training, and evaluating ML models while showcasing my ability to work across diverse domains within the field of AI.
