The code is a cost-benefit analysis using the ROC AUC curve in the context of binary classification with logistic regression. It starts by importing necessary libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn modules. A synthetic binary classification dataset is generated using make_classification, with 10 features (4 informative and 6 redundant) and 1,000 samples. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets. A logistic regression model is trained on the training data, and its predicted probabilities are used to evaluate the model performance via ROC curve metrics. The notebook proceeds to visualize the ROC curve and analyze the trade-offs between true positive and false positive rates. It incorporates a cost-benefit framework where different thresholds are tested to maximize the net benefit, considering assigned benefits for true positives and costs for false positives. This analysis helps identify the most optimal decision threshold for a given business or operational scenario.
